/*
Example 1:

      Input: words = ["one.two.three","four.five","six"], separator = "."
      Output: ["one","two","three","four","five","six"]
      Explanation: In this example we split as follows:
      
      "one.two.three" splits into "one", "two", "three"
      "four.five" splits into "four", "five"
      "six" splits into "six" 
      
      Hence, the resulting array is ["one","two","three","four","five","six"].


Example 2:

      Input: words = ["$easy$","$problem$"], separator = "$"
      Output: ["easy","problem"]
      Explanation: In this example we split as follows: 
      
      "$easy$" splits into "easy" (excluding empty strings)
      "$problem$" splits into "problem" (excluding empty strings)
      
      Hence, the resulting array is ["easy","problem"].


Example 3:

      Input: words = ["|||"], separator = "|"
      Output: []
      Explanation: In this example the resulting split of "|||" will contain only empty strings, so we return an empty array []. 
       

Constraints:

      1 <= words.length <= 100
      1 <= words[i].length <= 20
      characters in words[i] are either lowercase English letters or characters from the string ".,|$#@" (excluding the quotes)
      separator is a character from the string ".,|$#@" (excluding the quotes)
